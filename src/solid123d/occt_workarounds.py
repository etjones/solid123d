"""Gated workarounds for upstream OCCT/build123d defects.

Every OCCT workaround in solid123d, and where it lives. Two are
monkeypatches installed by importing this module, so no call site reveals
them; this list is the only place all five are visible.

In this module, as monkeypatches:

1. ``Shape.clean`` -- ``clean()`` deletes real geometry when the result
   holds a face crossed by a curved surface's parametric seam
   (gumyr/build123d#1428). The guarded version keeps the unclean shape
   when the clean would not conserve volume. Detailed below.

2. ``Shape._bool_op`` -- a boolean returns a *valid* shape missing most of
   its material when an operand nearly coincides with the accumulated
   result (a loop laying its last copy on its first, off by
   rotation-matrix noise: 17 mm^3 for what should have been 207). Such a
   result falls outside the bounds its inputs imply, and the same
   operation with a fuzzy tolerance gets it right. The retry climbs a
   short ladder of tolerances, each a fraction of the operands' own size;
   if no rung helps, it warns rather than pretending -- and asks
   ``why_occt_struggled`` whether an operand was something a boolean is
   defined on at all.

In ``_common``, as ordinary functions called from the operations that need
them, so these two *are* visible from their call sites:

3. ``bodies_of`` (used by ``boolean``) -- a boolean handed a compound of
   touching or overlapping bodies as one operand returns nonsense: a cut
   came back *larger* than its argument, and a fuse of a two-face sketch
   with a square returned a face of area 8e100. Passing every body as its
   own operand is equivalent by OCCT's own definition of the operation,
   and works.

4. ``fuse_bodies`` (used by ``group``, so by every union) -- a fuse can
   return more separate pieces than it was given, or pieces that overlap
   each other. A union joins material, so it can do neither: 6 bodies came
   back as 14 solids holding 20,393 of the 28,072 they should, 7 came back
   as 21 summing to negative zero, and 13 bars came back as 3 solids
   holding 637.74 where 616.37 was right. ``gained_bodies`` and
   ``bodies_overlap`` state the two invariants, and a violation retries on
   the same fraction-of-the-model ladder. The bounds check above cannot
   see any of it, because the interval from the largest input to the sum
   of the inputs is wide enough to hold all three answers.

5. ``cut_all`` (used by ``booleans.difference``) -- a cut can keep
   material inside the very shapes it cut with. OCCT split a sphere
   against a box across its middle and then kept the half the box
   covered; separately, one Cut taking every subtrahend at once returned
   the argument untouched where any four of the five cut correctly.
   ``material_left_in_tools`` states the invariant both violate, and only
   when it is violated does anything retry: a fuzzy value scaled to the
   model, then a fold tool by tool.

The split between this module and those three is deliberate. Here the
question is "is this result valid?", a property of one operation's output.
There it is "how should this operation be handed to OCCT?", a strategy the
call site owns. They also measure differently: the bounds check here uses
volume alone, which is 0 for 2D geometry, while ``cut_all`` falls back to
area -- so folding the no-op detection into the bounds check would either
lose 2D coverage or change the bounds semantics for every operation.

OCCT_SPHERE_SEAM_BUG_IS_UNFIXED gates the clean patch below. While
True (the current state of upstream), importing solid123d replaces
``build123d.Shape.clean`` with a volume-guarded version; set it to False
-- or delete the workaround entirely -- once upstream ships a fix, and
every call site reverts to stock build123d behavior. The canary test in
tests/test_occt_workarounds.py fails the moment an upgraded
build123d/OCCT no longer exhibits the bug, which is the signal to flip
this flag.

The bug (https://github.com/gumyr/build123d/issues/1428): ``clean()``
-- the ShapeUpgrade_UnifySameDomain pass build123d's boolean operators
run automatically -- deletes real geometry when the result contains a
face crossed by a curved surface's parametric seam. ``sphere(5) -
cube(8, center=True)`` loses the spherical cap its seam meridian
crosses (73.30 mm^3 instead of 87.96); the matching fuse loses the same
material and exports to STEP as faces only, which slicers read as zero
volume. The maintainer notes OCCT's seam handling as the underlying
culprit ("degenerate treatment of valid geometry containing curved
seams").

Patching ``Shape.clean`` -- rather than routing solid123d's own
booleans through raw BRepAlgoAPI calls -- is deliberate: it is the one
chokepoint every affected path shares. With it in place, solid123d's
``union()``/``difference()``/``intersection()``, build123d's native
``+``/``-``/``&`` on the shapes we hand out, and everything in scad123d
(which imports solid123d) all behave consistently. A call-site-only fix
would leave ``union()`` correct while a user's own ``a + b`` on the
same shapes silently lost material -- a confusing split.

The guarded clean preserves clean()'s contract exactly: it mutates
``self`` in place and returns it. The trial clean runs on a deepcopy
(clean() mutates as well as returns, so an in-place trial would destroy
the original), and its result is adopted only when volume is conserved.
Cost: one geometry copy and two mass computations per clean(); measured
cheaper than the unconditional clean it replaces (16.3 vs 22.9 ms per
sphere/cube fuse), since most cleans are accepted and the pathological
ones skip the expensive rebuild.

Caveat, stated in the upstream issue too: a volume guard protects
solids. A hypothetical clean() failure that conserved volume while
mangling faces would pass the guard.
