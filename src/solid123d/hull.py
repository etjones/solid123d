"""Analytic hull(): every case with a closed-form BRep answer.

- N equal-radius spheres: exactly offset(convex_hull_of_centers, r);
  verified against the Steiner formula to ~1e-10. A fully collinear set
  (the 2-post capsule/slot idiom) is built directly as a capsule.
- N equal-radius parallel cylinders sharing one axial span: the same
  reduction one dimension down -- 2D hull of the projected axes, offset by
  the radius, extruded ("rounded box from corner posts").
- Exactly two spheres of ANY radii: two spherical caps sewn to the external
  tangent cone (see _two_sphere_hull for the mathematics). Overlap and
  containment included.
- Exactly two 2D discs: the same tangent construction one dimension down,
  built directly as a wire (keyhole/slot idiom; equal radii = stadium).
- All-polyhedral children: exactly the convex hull of their combined
  vertices, via build123d's ConvexPolyhedron. Covers cubes, polyhedron()s,
  extruded polygons, and matrix-transformed anything-planar.

``analytic_hull`` returns None for anything else -- notably three or more
non-collinear spheres of unequal radii, whose hull needs tritangent planes
with power-diagram combinatorics, and any curved child outside the idioms
above (a curved surface's hull is not determined by its vertices). The
public ``hull()`` applier raises NotImplementedError on None; scad123d
instead falls back to rendering that subtree as a mesh via OpenSCAD.

Classification works on already-built Shapes rather than call arguments:
real code (BOSL2 especially) wraps primitives in layers of module-call and
attachment bookkeeping, and by classifying results those layers have
already been resolved.
