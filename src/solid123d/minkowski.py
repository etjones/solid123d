"""Rung 1: analytic Minkowski sums.

A Minkowski sum with a ball *is* an offset, which OCCT performs natively and
exactly. Since rounding is what the overwhelming majority of real minkowski()
calls are for, this covers most usage -- and the analytic result is better than
OpenSCAD's own, which is a faceted approximation.

Verified exact against the Steiner formula
    V(P (+) B_r) = V + A*r + (r^2/2) * sum(L_e * theta_e) + (4/3)*pi*r^3
to ~1e-10 relative error on convex and non-convex inputs.

Classification works on the *already-built* Shape, not on how the call was
written, for the same reason hull.py's classifiers do: real module-heavy code
(BOSL2 in particular) wraps a "bare" primitive in many layers of group/
multmatrix/intersection from module-call and attachment-point bookkeeping,
including auxiliary sibling nodes that build to nothing. Reading the raw CSG
tree would mean re-solving all of that; the existing walker has already done
it correctly by the time this runs, so this only has to look at the result.

The ball may be an analytic sphere/circle, or a many-vertex polyhedron/polygon
whose vertices are all equidistant from a common centroid -- a real case, not
a hypothetical one: BOSL2's own `cuboid(rounding=r)` builds its rounding
kernel as an explicit 258-vertex polyhedron (radius exact to ~1e-6) rather
than calling `sphere()`.
