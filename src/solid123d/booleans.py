"""OpenSCAD boolean operations: ``union()(a, b)``, ``difference()(a, b)``.

Note that because primitives are native build123d shapes, the algebra
operators also work directly: ``a + b`` (union), ``a - b`` (difference),
``a & b`` (intersection). SolidPython's ``a * b`` intersection operator
is NOT available — use ``a & b`` or ``intersection()(a, b)``.

``hull()`` and ``minkowski()`` evaluate every case that has a closed-form
BRep answer (see hull.py and minkowski.py) and raise NotImplementedError
for the rest — build123d has no general convex-hull or Minkowski operator,
and a faceted approximation would defeat the point of a BRep kernel.
