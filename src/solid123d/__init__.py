"""solid123d: run SolidPython code on the build123d kernel.

Change ``from solid import ...`` to ``from solid123d import ...`` and the
same code produces native build123d shapes, which can be mixed freely
with regular build123d code and exported to STEP/STL.

# patch Shape.clean process-wide so union() and a user's own `a + b`
# behave identically. Flip the flag off once upstream is fixed.
