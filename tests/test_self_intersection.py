"""Naming what OCCT will not do, once a boolean has already failed.

A solid that passes BRepCheck can still intersect itself, and OCCT's
booleans are only defined on arguments that do not. `is_valid` does not
test for it, so such a shape calls itself valid right up to the point
where every cut of it comes back inside out.

`BOPAlgo_ArgumentAnalyzer` is the checker OCCT ships for the question. It
is a full intersection pass, as expensive as the boolean itself, so it
runs only after an invariant has failed and no repair has helped --
never as a precondition.
