"""The two things a union cannot do, and what happens when OCCT does them.

A union joins material: it can never return more separate pieces than it
was given, and its pieces can never overlap. Both are statements about
the answer, so they need no reference render -- which is the point, since
the volume guard's interval (largest input .. sum of inputs) is wide
enough to hold either failure.
